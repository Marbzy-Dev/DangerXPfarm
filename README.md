- Automatic XP rewards while inside the zone
- Configurable danger phase with damage over time
- Visual red particle borders for region boundaries
- Regions persist across server restarts

## 🛠 Commands
- `/dxp wand` — Get the selection tool
- `/dxp create <name>` — Create a new XP zone
- `/dxp delete <name>` — Delete a zone
- `/dxp list` — List all zones (click to teleport)
- `/dxp reload` — Reload the configuration

## ⚙️ Configuration
All settings are customizable in `config.yml`:
